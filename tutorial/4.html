<h1>Pixel Quilt Tutorial 4: Loops</h1>
<h2>Leading by Example</h2>
<p>Let's start with some examples that make use of loops and then get into the
details</p>
<editor>
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    set(x, 0, 255, 0, 0);
    wait(1/8);
}
</editor>
<editor>
for (b of [0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250]) {
    set(2, 2, 0, 0, b);
    wait(1/2);
}
</editor>
<editor>
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    for (y of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        set(x, y, 0, 128, 255);
    }
}
</editor>
<editor>
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    for (y of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        r = x * 15;
        g = y * 15;
        b = r + g;
        set(x, y, r, g, b);
    }
}
</editor>
<h2>Doing Things Multiple Times</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want our code to do something more than once. We can tell it to
do the same thing over and over again, but it gets annoying and the code
becomes long and hard to read. This is where loops come in. Loops allow us to
do something multiple times, often with slight variations each time.</p>
<p>Starting off simple, let's say we wanted to make a pixel blink 4 times and
then stay solid for a bit. We could write this like this example:</p>
<editor>
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<p>But that's a lot of copying of the code and it takes a lot of reading to see
that it is just doing the same thing 4 times in a row. We could write the same
thing instead like below:</p>
<editor>
for (i of [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
    set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
    set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
}
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<p>If you watch the output, they do the same thing, but the second one is a
lot shorter. That's because blinking the pixel on and off each of the 4 times
is exactly the same, so we can just tell it to do it 4 times.</p>
<p>We can make it repeat any number of times by changing how many numbers we
list in between the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> in the line with
<code>for</code>. Everything between the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> gets
repeated that many times.</p>
<question answer="3">How many times will the loop run in this code?<br>
<code>for (i of [1, 2, 3]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;wait(1);</code><br>
<code>}</code></question>
<h2>Doing Things, but Differently</h2>
<p>The real power of loops comes not when you do the same thing multiple times,
but when you do them slightly differently each time. You may have noticed that
there is what looks like a variable in the loop statement
<code>for (x of [1, 2, 3]) {</code>. That's because there is, <code>x</code> is
a variable.</p>
<p>What's important about the variable in the loop though, is that each time
the loop repeats it will take a different value. The loop will run once for
each value you put between <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, with
<code>x</code> set to the next value in the list each time it runs. This means
we can take the same blinking example from above but use <code>i</code> to make
it different each time it runs.</p>
<editor>
for (i of [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
    set(i, 0, 255, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
    set(i, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
}
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<p>What's more, the numbers in the list don't have to be in order, or all of
the numbers between two values. You can write whatever numbers you want and
even repeat them if you want. Let's take the same blinking example and make it
move around differently:</p>    
<editor>
for (i of [3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]) {
    set(i, 0, 255, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
    set(i, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
}
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<question answer="4">
How many pixels will be turned on after this loops runs?<br>
<code>for (x of [0, 2, 4, 6]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;set(x, 0, 255, 255, 0);</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</question>
<question answer="(3, 2)">
Which coordinate will be the last one to turn on in this loop?<br>
<code>for (x of [7, 1, 5, 3]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;set(x, 2, 0, 128, 255);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;wait(1);</code><br>
<code>}</code>
</question>
<h2>Nested Loops</h2>
<p>While using a loop can be powerful, using more than one can be much more
powerful and lead to code in a few lines that would otherwise take
hundreds.</p>
<p>This is because loops don't just have to contain <code>set</code> and
<code>wait</code> lines, but can contain additional loops. Doing this is called
<b>nested loops</b>.</p>
<p>In a basic example of nested loops, we can take the example where we made
the blinking pixel move and make it repeat multiple times before staying still:
</p>
<editor>
for (repeat of [1, 2, 3]) {
    for (i of [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
        set(i, 0, 255, 0, 0);
        wait(1/4);
        set(i, 0, 0, 0, 0);
        wait(1/4);
    }
}
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<p>What's important to note is that we used a <i>different</i> variable in the
nested loop, that is, the loop inside the second loop. The outer loop uses
<code>repeat</code> as the variable while the inner loop uses <code>i</code>.
</p>
<p>Since we use different variable names for each loop, we can also use each
variable inside the loops to make the code do something different each time.
When you have nested loop like</p>
<code>for (outer of [1, 2, 3]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (inner of [4, 5, 6]) {</code><br>
<p>it is important to note that each time <code>outer</code> changes,
<code>inner</code> will go through the full list of values for that loop. For
this loop it means whatever is inside will run 9 times with the following
values in order:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>outer = 1, inner = 4</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 1, inner = 5</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 1, inner = 6</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 2, inner = 4</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 2, inner = 5</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 2, inner = 6</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 3, inner = 4</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 3, inner = 5</code></li>
<li><code>outer = 3, inner = 6</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see an example of using this for something useful below:</p>
<editor>
// Sweep the rows
for (row of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    // Sweep the columns
    for (column of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        set(colum, row, 0, 128, 32);
        wait(1/8);
    }
}
</editor>
<p>That example has a <code>wait</code> in the loop so that you can see how the
loops work, but if you remove that line you'll see this is an easy way to make
the whole display a single color using only 5 lines of code rather than 64
individual <code>set</code> statements, one for each pixel.</p>
<question answer="6">
How many times will the <code>wait</code> line run in this code?<br>
<code>for (outer of [1, 2]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (inner of [1, 3, 5]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait(1);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br>
<code>}</code>    
</question>
<question answer="(3, 1)">
Will the coordinate (3, 1) or (1, 2) be set first in this code?<br>
<code>for (y of [1, 2, 3]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;for (x of [1, 2, 3]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set(x, y, 255, 255, 255);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait(1);</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;}</code><br>
<code>}</code>    
</question>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Recall the exercise from the animation tutorial where you made a line move
across the display. Now use loops to make an animation that moves a whole row
from the top to the bottom of the display. Here's some starter code that colors
a row.</p>
<editor>
r = 255;
g = 145;
b = 0;
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    set(x, 0, r, g, b);
}
