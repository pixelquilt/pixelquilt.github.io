<h1>Pixel Quilt Tutorial 4: Loops</h1>
<h2>Leading by Example</h2>
<p>Let's start with some examples that make use of loops and then get into the
details</p>
<editor>
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    set(x, 0, 255, 0, 0);
}
</editor>
<editor>
for (b of [0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250]) {
    set(2, 2, 0, 0, b);
    wait(1/2);
}
</editor>
<editor>
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    for (y of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        set(x, y, 0, 128, 255);
    }
}
</editor>
<editor>
for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
    for (y of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        r = x * 15;
        g = y * 15;
        b = r + g;
        set(x, y, r, g, b);
    }
}
</editor>
<h2>Doing Things Multiple Times</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want our code to do something more than once. We can tell it to
do the same thing over and over again, but it gets annoying and the code
becomes long and hard to read. This is where loops come in. Loops allow us to
do something multiple times, often with slight variations each time.</p>
<p>Starting off simple, let's say we wanted to make a pixel blink 4 times and
then stay solid for a bit. We could write this like this example:</p>
<editor>
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1/4);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<p>But that's a lot of copying of the code and it takes a lot of reading to see
that it is just doing the same thing 4 times in a row. We could write the same
thing instead like below:</p>
<editor>
for (i of [1, 2, 3, 4]) {
    set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
    set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
    wait(1/4);
}
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(5);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(1);
</editor>
<p>If you watch the output, they do the same thing, but the second one is a
lot shorter. That's because blinking the pixel on and off each of the 4 times
is exactly the same, so we can just tell it to do it 4 times.</p>
<p>We can make it repeat any number of times by changing how many numbers we
list in between the <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> in the line with
<code>for</code>. Everything between the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> gets
repeated that many times.</p>
<question answer="3">How many times will the loop run in this code?<br>
<code>for (i of [1, 2, 3]) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;wait(1);</code><br>
<code>}</code></question>
