<h1>Pixel Quilt Tutorial 7: Local Variables</h1>
<h2>Leading by Example</h2>



<h2>Scoping It Out</h2>
<p>If you asked a question and somebody told you to "ask Pat," the first thing
you would have to figure out is who Pat is. If you're at school, you might
first think about whether somebody in your class is named Pat. If not, maybe
there's somebody else in your grade. If not, perhaps somebody else at the
school that you would know. Barring that, perhaps they meant somebody outside
of school and you start thinking about friends, family, etc.</p>
<p>The key here is that you're looking for Pat in the group that is closest to
the current situation, the context in which you are looking. Code has a similar
concept called <b>scopes</b> or sometimes <b>lexical scopes</b>.</p>
<p>When you use a variable <code>x</code>, the quilt will look for what you
mean by <code>x</code> starting in the closest scope and going further away
until it finds something called <code>x</code>. Once it finds <code>x</code>,
it stops and uses that variable. If it never finds one, it gives you an error
that <code>x</code> is unknown or not defined.</p>
<p>In the diagram below, scopes are represented by colored boxes. In each box
we show some variables with values. After the diagram we'll discuss some
examples of using variables in these scopes, and then review with some
questions.</p>

<div style="margin: 20px; padding: 5px; background-color: #c66;">
    <b>Red scope</b><br>
    <code>x = 1</code><br>
    <code>y = 4</code><br>
    <div style="margin: 20px; padding: 5px; background-color: #6c6;">
        <b>Green scope</b><br>
        <code>x = 3</code><br>
        <code>z = 7</code><br>
        <div style="margin: 20px; padding: 5px; background-color: #66c;">
            <b>Blue scope</b><br>
            <code>y = 9</code><br>
            <code>x = 5</code>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>In the above example, if we had code in the blue scope and we used the
variable <code>x</code>, it would have the value 5. If we were in the green
scope, it would be 3. If we were in the red scope and used the variable
<code>z</code>, we would get an error because there is no variabled called
<code>z</code> in the red scope or any scope that red is inside.</p>

<question answer="9">
What would be the value of the variable <code>y</code> in the blue scope in the
above diagram?
</question>
<question answer="4 (coming from the red scope)">
What would be the value of the variable <code>y</code> in the green scope in
the above diagram?
</question>
<question answer="7 (coming from the green scope)">
What would be the value of the variable <code>z</code> in the blue scope in the
above diagram?
</question>
