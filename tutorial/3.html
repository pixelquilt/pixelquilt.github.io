<h1>Pixel Quilt Tutorial 3: Variables</h1>
<h2>Leading by Example</h2>
<p>Like in the previous tutorial, we're going to start off with some examples
that you can play with, then we'll go into the explanations.</p>
<editor>
x = 3;
y = 4;
set(x, y, 255, 0, 0);
</editor>
<editor>
x = 3;
set(x, 1, 255, 255, 0);
set(x, 2, 255, 255, 0);
set(x, 3, 255, 255, 0);
x = 4;
set(x, 1, 128, 0, 255);
set(x, 2, 128, 0, 255);
set(x, 3, 128, 0, 255);
</editor>
<editor>
red = 255;
green = 255;
blue = 0;
row = 2;
column = 4;
set(column, row, red, green, blue);
</editor>
<editor>
speed = 1/5;
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
wait(speed);
set(0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
wait(speed);
</editor>
<h2>X Marks the Value</h2>
<p>If you look at the above examples you may notice that anywhere we would
write a number in previous tutorials, we can also write a letter or word, as
long as we tell the computer beforehand what that letter or word should mean.
These letters or words are called <b>variables</b>.</p>
<p>Variables act as placeholders when we don't want to (or can't) write a value
directly in our code. One common reason to use variables is to not have to
repeat something, especially if we want to change it easily. Take the following
example, where without a variable we would have to write the color on each line
and if we wanted to make the color a little different we would have to change
it in a lot of places:</p>
<editor>
// Try changing these to make the dot orange or purple
red = 0;
green = 128;
blue = 255;
set(3, 2, red, green, blue);
set(4, 2, red, green, blue);
set(2, 3, red, green, blue);
set(3, 3, red, green, blue);
set(4, 3, red, green, blue);
set(5, 3, red, green, blue);
set(2, 4, red, green, blue);
set(3, 4, red, green, blue);
set(4, 4, red, green, blue);
set(5, 4, red, green, blue);
set(3, 5, red, green, blue);
set(4, 5, red, green, blue);
</editor>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a1').style.display='block'">In the
following code, what coordinate will get turned yellow?<br>
<code>x = 2</code><br>
<code>set(x, 5, 255, 255, 0)</code>
</question>
<answer id="a1">Answer: (2, 5)</answer>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a2').style.display='block'">What
do we need to add to the beginning of this code to make it turn the pixel
blue?<br>
<code>r = 0;</code><br>
<code>g = 0;</code><br>
<code>set(2, 2, r, g, b)</code>
</question>
<answer id="a2">Answer: b = 255;</answer>
<h2>Variables that, well, vary!</h2>
<p>In one of the examples at the top, the variable x is given a value twice.
First it is told to be 3, then it is told to be 4. This is because when you use
a variable, the value that gets used is the latest one it has been given. If
you give a variable a new value, it only applies for the things that run after
(below) the line that changed it.</p>
<p>In the below code for example, the orange highlighted lines have a value of
2 for x, while the blue highlighted lines have a value of 5 for x:</p>
<code>x = 2;</code><br>
<code style="background-color: #fc6;">set(x, 1, 255, 255, 255);</code><br>
<code style="background-color: #fc6;">set(x, 2, 255, 255, 255);</code><br>
<code>x = 5;</code><br>
<code style="background-color: #69f;">set(x, 1, 255, 0, 0);</code><br>
<code style="background-color: #69f;">set(x, 2, 255, 0, 0);</code><br>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a3').style.display='block'">In the
following code, what is the coordinate of the pixel that gets turned blue?<br>
<code>x = 0;</code><br>
<code>x = 1;</code><br>
<code>set(x, 3, 255, 0, 0);</code><br>
<code>x = 2;</code><br>
<code>set(x, 3, 0, 0, 255);</code><br>
<code>x = 3;</code><br>
<code>set(x, 3, 0, 255, 0);</code>
</question>
<answer id="a3">Answer: (2, 3)</answer>
<h2>Math with Variables</h2>
<p>In the last tutorial we discovered that you can put math anywhere where you
would put a number. That includes when you are telling the quilt what a
variable should represent. Instead of putting <code>x = 3</code> we could just
as easily put <code>x = 2 + 1</code> or any other mathematical expression.</p>
<code>x = 1 + 3;</code><br>
<code>y = 2 * 2;</code><br>
<code>r = 255 - 100;</code><br>
<code>g = 255 / 4;</code><br>
<code>b = 255 / 5 + 100;</code><br>
<code>set(x, y, r, g, b);</code><br>
<p>In addition to using math to tell the quilt the value of a variable, we can
also use variables to represent the numbers used in math, as long as the quilt
already knows the values of those variables. For example, if we want the
<code>y</code> variable to be one more than the <code>x</code> variable, we can
write <code>y = x + 1;</code>.</p>
<p>Take this example, where we use math with variables to set a color from a
single number:</p>
<editor>
// Change this to go from blue to red.
redness = 64;
r = redness;
b = 255 - redness;
set(0, 0, r, 0, b);
// Change this to make a brighter or darker orange.
brightness = 1/2;
r = 255 * brightness;
g = 128 * brightness;
set(7, 0, r, g, 0);
</editor>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a4').style.display='block'">What
is the value of x after this code?<br>
<code>y = 5;</code><br>
<code>x = y - 2;</code>
</question>
<answer id="a4">Answer: 3</answer>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a5').style.display='block'">Bonus:
What is the value of x after this code?<br>
<code>x = 2;</code><br>
<code>y = 3 * x;</code><br>
<code>x = y - 2;</code>
</question>
<answer id="a5">Answer: 4</answer>
<h2>What is in a (Variable) Name?</h2>
<p>In this tutorial we've used various letters and words as the names of
variables, so can we use anything we want? Almost. There are a few limitations
and important notes about variable naming to keep in mind. If something doesn't
seem to be working or you're getting an error, try changing the variable name
to see if that helps.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Uppercase and lowercase</b>
<ul><li>Uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter are not the same
when it comes to variable names. The variable <code>R</code> and the variable
<code>r</code> are different and have nothing to do with each other. Similarly,
<code>Adam</code>, <code>adam</code>, and <code>aDam</code> are all different
variables.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Numbers</b>
<ul><li>Variable names can have numbers in them, but not at the start. That is,
you can have a variable named <code>cat1</code> but not <code>1cat</code>.
Trying to use <code>1cat</code> as a variable will cause an error trying to run
your code.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Special names</b>
<ul><li>Some names have special meaning to the quilt and cannot be used in
variables, or in some cases using them will make the code do strange things.
This includes various words that are reserved parts of JavaScript or the web
browser including <code>if</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>,
<code>do</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>new</code>, <code>class</code>,
<code>let</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>window</code>,
<code>document</code>, and others, as well as <code>set</code>, and
<code>wait</code>, which already mean things to the quilt.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Other characters</b><ul><li>
Besides letters and numbers, variables can usually only contain one other
character, the underscore (<code>_</code>). Any other characters will not be
considered part of the name and will likely not do what you expect. People
often use underscores to separate words in a variable name, since spaces also
cannot be used. For example <code>a_variable_with_multiple_words</code>.
</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
Make a program where you can change the color of a shape or animation by only
changing variables at the top. Here is some code to start:
<editor>
r = 255;
g = 128;
b = 0;
// Draw a shape or make an animation.
</editor>
