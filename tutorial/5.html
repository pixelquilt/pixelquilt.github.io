<h2>What If?</h2>
<p>Especially when it comes to loops, there are cases when we sometimes want to
do something and sometimes don't. Take the first example, where we want a line
that changes color halfway through. We could make two loops, one for the first
half of the line and one for the second half, but we don't need to. Instead we
can add a <b>conditional</b>.</p>
<p>Conditionals are lines that tell the quilt to do something only if a
<b>condition</b> is true. In the case of the loop in our example, we use a
<b>comparison</b> as a condition to tell the quilt to change the values of
<code>r</code> and <code>g</code> <i>only</i> if x is at least 4.</p>
<p>Conditionals most commonly use comparisons, with common comparisons being
ones you may have seen in math class:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a &lt; b</code><ul><li>
The condition is true if the value of a (or whatever is to the left of the
<code>&lt;</code>) is less than (smaller than) b (or whatever is to the
right of the <code>&gt;</code>).
</li></ul></li>
<li><code>a &gt; b</code><ul><li>
The condition is true if the value of a is greater than (larger than) b.
</li></ul></li>
<li><code>a &lt;= b</code><ul><li>
The condition is true is the value of a is less than or equal to (the same as)
the value of b.
</li></ul></li>
<li><code>a &gt;= b</code><ul><li>
The condition is true is the value of a is greater than or equal to the value
of b.
</li></ul></li>
<li><code>a == b</code><ul><li>
The condition is true if a and b hold the same value.
</li><li>
Note that you may be tempted to use <code>a = b</code>, but this would set the
value of a to the value stored in b, not compare the two of them.
</li></ul></li>
<li><code>a != b</code><ul><li>
The condition is true if a and b hold different values.
</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<question answer="3 > 1">
Which of these conditions would be considered true?<br>
<code>2 == 4</code><br>
<code>4 &gt;= 5</code><br>
<code>3 &gt; 1</code><br>
<code>3 != 3</code></question>
<question answer="2">
Which value of <code>x</code> would make the condition <code>x &lt; 3</code>
true?<br>
<code>2</code><br>
<code>3</code><br>
<code>4</code>
</question>

<h2>What Else?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you don't just want to do something or not do something, you want
to do one thing or another. You could say <code>if (a == b)</code> and then
follow it with another <code>if (a != b)</code>, but that gets cumbersome and
complicated.</p>
<p>Instead we can use an <b>else</b> block after the conditional. When you
write</p>
<code>if (a == b) {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;set(0, 0, 1, 2, 3);</code><br>
<code>} else {</code><br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;set(4, 4, 1, 2, 3);</code><br>
<code>}</code>
<p>the lines between the first pair of <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> will
run if the condition is true (a and b are the same), whereas the lines between
the second pair (after the <code>else</code> will run if the condition was
false (a and b are not the same.</p>
<p>This allows us to easily write either-or logic like the second example at
the top where we set the pixel to white on odd numbers and black on even ones.
</p>
<question answer="When x is less than 4">
If we have a condition that checks if <code>x >= 4</code>, when will the else
block run?
</question>

<h2>This, That, and the Other Thing</h2>
<p>While you can nest conditionals like the nested loops for the previous
tutorial, sometimes you don't really want to. Sometimes you want to check
whether multiple things are all true (if the store has my favorite candy
<b>and</b> I have enough money), and sometimes you want to check whether any
one of multiple things is true (if my brother is home <b>or</b> my sister is
home).</p>
<p>We can do this with our code by using two special <b>operators</b>,
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, and <code>||</code>. If we say <code>x &gt; 2
&amp;&amp; y &lt; 8</code>, the condition will be true only if <b>both</b>
<code>x</code> is greater than 2 <b>AND</b> <code>y</code> is less than 8.</p>
<p>Similarly, <code>x &gt; 2 || y &lt; 8</code> would be true if either
<code>x</code> is greater than 2 <b>OR</b> if <code>y</code> is less than 8
(or both).</p>
<p>This can be especially useful with nested loops, where we may want to check
a comparison on the x coordinate and y coordinate at the same time.</p>
<question answer="True">
Is <code>3 &lt; 2 || 4 &lt;= 4</code> true or false?
</question>
<question answer="False">
Is <code>1 &gt;= 3 && 3 == 3 </code> true or false?
</question>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Starting with the code below that uses nested loops from the previous
tutorial to color the entire display, change the code to use conditionals to
give each of the four corners different colors without using any more loops or
set statements outside of the loop.</p>

    for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        set(x, y, 0, 128, 128);
    }
}
