<h1>Pixel Quilt Tutorial 1: Coordinates and Colors</h1>
<h2>Coordinates</h2>
<p>The Pixel Quilt, like many displays, is divided into evenly spaced columns
and rows of pixels. Pixel Quilts come in various sizes, but for this tutorial
we’ll assume a 32x32 quilt.</p>

<p>The columns of a 32x32 Pixel Quilt are numbered starting at 0 on the left
and ending at 31 on the right, like in the diagram below.</p>

TODO

<p>Similarly, the rows are numbered starting at 0 on the top and ending at 31
on the bottom like in the diagram below.</p>

TODO

<p>The location of a pixel in the quilt, often called its <b>coordinate</b>, is
given by listing the column first, followed by the row. The column is also
called the <b>x coordinate</b>, and the row the <b>y coordinate</b>. The full
coordinate is often written (x, y). The diagram below shows the coordinates of
some of the pixels in the quilt.</p>

TODO

<p>As a further example, if we referred to the coordinate (5, 2) on a 32x32
quilt, we’d be talking about the blue one in the below diagram.</p>

<h2>Colors</h2>
<p>Colors on the Pixel Quilt, again like many displays, are made by combining
red, green, and blue light in various proportions. Red, green, and blue are the
<b>primary</b> colors of an <b>additive</b> color system. This is different
from a subtractive color system like is used with ink and paints.</p>

<p>Combining the three primary colors gives the vast majority of colors that a
human eye can see. Scientifically this is because human eyes have three color
receptors that roughly correspond to the red, green, and blue colors and
everything else we see is from a combination of the three receptors.</p>

<p>As an example, combining red and green makes yellow. Combining red and blue
makes magenta (aka violet or purple). Combining all three makes white. The
absence of any of the colors makes black. Some of the basic combinations of
colors can be seen in the below diagram.</p>

TODO

<p>The three primary colors don’t have to be just there or not though, they can
each have varying levels. Having more green than red gives a yellow-green tint
while more red than green gives an orange tint. In addition, even the primary
colors can be made darker by having them at less than full, and many more
colors can be produced by combining levels of all three primary colors.</p>

<p>On the pixel quilt, as with many computer systems, colors are represented
with three numbers r, g, and b representing the levels for red, green, and
blue. Each number can range from 0 meaning the color is completely off, to 255
meaning the color is completely on. These colors are often written in the form
(r, g, b), for example (255, 0, 0) for a solid red color.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('a3').style.display='block'">Which of
the following represents the solid blue color?<br>
(0, 255, 0)<br>
(255, 255, 0)<br>
(0, 0, 255)</question>
<answer id="a3">Answer: (0, 0, 255)</answer>

<question onclick="document.querySelector('a4').style.display='block'">What
color is represented by (255, 128, 0)?<br>
Purple<br>
Orange<br>
Yellow</question>
<answer id="a4">Answer: Orange</answer>

<question onclick="document.querySelector('a5').style.display='block'">Does
(100, 150, 200) have more red or more blue?</question>
<answer id="a5">Answer: More blue</answer>

<h2>Combining Coordinates and Colors</h2>
<p>When we combine the coordinate and color concepts above, we can specify the
color that the Pixel Quilt should make a specific pixel. For example, if we
tell it to set the pixel at (1, 4) to (255, 255, 0) we get the following
output.</p>

TODO

<p>One of the basic things we can do with the pixel quilt is exactly that, tell
it what color to make a given pixel. This is done with the <b>set</b> function.
To call set, we write the word set followed immediately by an open parenthesis,
the arguments separated by commas, and then a closed parenthesis. This should
be on a line by itself, optionally with a semicolon (;) at the end, looking
something like this:</p>

<code>set(argument1, argument2, …);</code>

<p>The arguments to the <b>set</b> function are the coordinate and color just
as we’ve discussed them in this tutorial. The coordinate and color do not get
their own parentheses like we wrote them above but are combined as the
arguments to the set function in the order x, y, r, g, b.</p>

<code>set(x, y, r, g, b);</code>

<p>To see an example of this in practice, copy the following code into the
<a href="/programmer">Pixel Quilt Programmer</a> (pixelquilt.net/programmer).
You can comment out any of the set statements by adding // to the beginning of
the line and see how it affects the output.
<h3>Example Code</h3>
<codeblock>
// Set the top left pixel to red
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
// Set the pixel two to the right to green
set(2, 0, 0, 255, 0);
// Set the pixel in the fourth column and the seventh row to white
set(3, 6, 255, 255, 255);
</codeblock>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>To demonstrate the concepts of this tutorial, write a Pixel Quilt script
using the programmer that colors the top left corner of the grid yellow, the
top right blue, the bottom left white, and the bottom right magenta.</p>
