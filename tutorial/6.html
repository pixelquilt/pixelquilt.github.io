<h2>Teaching the Quilt New Tricks</h2>
<p>The quilt only knows how to do two things: set a pixel color and wait. But
what if we could teach it new things? Like how to draw a line, a box, a circle,
or even a cat? That's where <b>functions</b> come in. Functions allow you to
teach the quilt something new and put a name to it.</p>
<p>There are many examples of this that you are likely already familiary with
in real life. You may have learned how to do a jumping jack in PE class for
example, or how to throw or kick a ball. Each of these requires you to do
multiple steps. Throwing a ball for example you have to grasp the ball, raise
your arm, move it forward, and release the ball. But once you learn how to do
it, the teacher or coach can just tell you to throw a ball without going over
the individual steps.</p>
<p>Playing a musical instrument provides another good source of analogies.
Whether it is piano, guitar, violin, or flute, playing a note requires you to
do multiple things, but you eventually learn how to just "play D" or the like.
Chords are an even better example, especially with instruments like the guitar
or ukelele where playing a chord requires you to put different fingers in
different places and then strum the strings. But once you learn to do that, you
can be told to just play a G major without being told all of the parts of doing
so.</p>
<p>Functions are a way to tell a computer what the steps are do doing something
and then do it just by using its name. A basic function looks like this:</p>
<codeblock>function myFunction() {
  some lines
  of code
}</codeblock>
<p>The word <code>function</code> is always there, followed by the name we want
to give the function. Functions can be named just like variables, but it is
useful to use names that help you remember what the function does. Then
everything between the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> is what is called the
<b>function body</b>. The function body holds the steps that are needed to
perform the quilt's new ability.</p>
<p>This function from the first example colors three pixels red, green, and
blue:</p>
<codeblock>function on() {
  set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
  set(1, 0, 0, 255, 0);
  set(2, 0, 0, 0, 255);
}</codeblock>
<p>Once we have told the quilt what that function means, we can tell it to use
that new ability by writing the name of the function followed by
<code>()</code>, so <code>on()</code> for this example. This is called
<b>calling</b> the function. We can call the function any number of times
anywhere that we would write another line of code. In the first example we call
the <code>on</code> and <code>off</code> functions multiple times to make the
pixels blink a custom pattern.</p>
<p>Every time we call the function, it is as if we copied everything between
the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> for the function and replaced the
function call with it. So with our above example of <code>on</code>, the
code</p>
<codeblock>on();
wait(1);
on();</codeblock>
<p>Is the same as:</p>
<codeblock>set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
set(1, 0, 0, 255, 0);
set(2, 0, 0, 0, 255);
wait(1);
set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
set(1, 0, 0, 255, 0);
set(2, 0, 0, 0, 255);</codeblock>

<question answer="4, each time draw is called it sets a pixel twice, and draw is called twice">
How many times will the following code set a pixel?<br>
<codeblock>function draw() {
  set(1, 0, 255, 255, 255);
  set(0, 1, 128, 128, 128);
}
draw();
draw();</codeblock>
</question>
<question answer="30 (5 sets per call * 6 calls)">
If I have a function that sets pixels 5 times and I call that function 6 times,
how many times will I set a pixel?
</question>
<h2>Let's Start An Argument</h2>
<p>Teaching the quilt how to do the same thing whenever we want is great and
powerful, but it would be even more powerful if we could give it some
information to use when doing that thing. For example, your coach could tell
you how hard to throw a ball. Or your conductor could tell you how loud to play
a note or chord. We can do the same with functions by giving it what are called
<b>arguments</b>.</p>
<p>Take for example this function that turns the top left pixel red:</p>
<codeblock>function red() {
  set(0, 0, 255, 0, 0);
}</codeblock>
<p>That's great if we want to color the top left pixel red a lot, but what if
we want to color a different pixel red? We can add an <b>argument</b> to the
function like this:</p>
<codeblock>function red(x) {
  set(x, 0, 255, 0, 0);
};
red(0);
red(1);</codeblock>
<p>By putting a variable name inside the <code>()</code> after the function
name, we can then use that variable in the function body just like we did with
other variables in earlier tutorials. The difference is that the value of the
variable will be decided by the line that <b>calls</b> the function.</p>
<p>When we get to the <code>red(0);</code> line, we're telling it what the
value of x will be when the function runs. This is called <b>passing</b> an
argument. The <code>red(0);</code> line effectively becomes:</p>
<codeblock>x = 0;
set(x, 0, 255, 0, 0);
</codeblock>
<p>Note that it isn't exactly the same because it doesn't make a variable
called x outside of the <code>red</code> function body, but we'll get into
those details in a later tutorial.</p>
<p>Continuing the expansion, the whole code above essentially becomes:</p>
<codeblock>x = 0;
set(x, 0, 255, 0, 0);
x = 1;
set(x, 0, 255, 0, 0);
</codeblock>
<question answer="(2, 3)">
What coordinate will get turned yellow in the following code?
<codeblock>function yellow(y) {
  set(2, y, 255, 255, 0);
}
yellow(3);
</codeblock>
</question>
<question answer="4">
How many different pixels will be blue after the following code?
<codeblock>function blue(x) {
  set(x, x, 0, 0, 255);
}
blue(0);
blue(2);
blue(4);
blue(6);
</codeblock>
</question>

<h2>When One Argument Isn't Enough</h2>
<p>Passing an argument like above is very useful, but sometimes one argument
won't cut it for our needs. Take the above <code>red</code> example, we can
tell it which column to put the red pixel in, but wouldn't it be great if we
could also tell it which row?</p>
<p>It would be great, and we can do exactly that by passing <i>multiple</i>
arguments to the function like so:</p>
<codeblock>function red(x, y) {
  set(x, y, 255, 0, 0);
}
red(0, 0);
red(0, 1);
red(1, 0);
</codeblock>
<p>This works just like with a single argument, but we give more than one
variable name separated by <code>,</code> when we write the function, and we
put more than one value between the <code>()</code> when we call the function.
Just like in the previous section, this effectively becomes:</p>
<codeblock>x = 0;
y = 0;
set(x, y, 255, 0, 0);
x = 0;
y = 1;
set(x, y, 255, 0, 0);
x = 1;
y = 0;
set(x, y, 255, 0, 0);
</codeblock>
<p>We can give a function any number of arguments as long as we pass the same
number of arguments every time we call it.</p>
<question answer="(4, 1)">
Which pixel would get turned red if we called <code>red(4, 1);</code> with the
code from this section?
</question>
<question answer="3 (red, green, and blue)">
How many arguments does this function take?
<codeblock>function corner(red, green, blue) {
  set(0, 0, red, green, blue);
}</codeblock>
</question>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Write a function that makes the entire display a solid color and use it to
make an animation that changes the color of the display to various colors over
time. Here is some starter code with a function that draws a blue line:</p>
<editor>
function blueline(y) {
    for (x of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) {
        set(x, y, 0, 0, 255);
    }
}
blueline(3);
</editor>
