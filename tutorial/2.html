<h1>Pixel Quilt Tutorial 2: Animation</h1>
<h2>Leading by Example</h2>
<p>We're going to start this tutorial right off with some example code showing
basic animations. Feel free to play with them, then we'll discuss more details
of how they work.</p>
<editor>
// Start with yellow
set(0, 0, 255, 255, 0);
wait(1);
// Add white
set(1, 1, 255, 255, 255);
wait(1);
// Add blue
set(2, 2, 0, 0, 255);
wait(1);
</editor>
<editor>
// Start with a red dot
set(4, 4, 255, 0, 0);
wait(1/2);
// Change it to orange
set(4, 4, 255, 128, 0);
wait(1/2);
// Then other colors;
set(4, 4, 255, 255, 0);
wait(1/2);
set(4, 4, 0, 255, 0);
wait(1/2);
set(4, 4, 0, 255, 255);
wait(1/2);
set(4, 4, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1/2);
set(4, 4, 0, 0, 255);
wait(1/2);
set(4, 4, 128, 0, 255);
wait(1/2);
set(4, 4, 255, 0, 255);
wait(1/2);
</editor>
<editor>
// We don't always have to wait the same duration
set(0, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(2);
set(1, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1);
set(2, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1/2);
set(3, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1/4);
set(4, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1/8);
set(5, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1/16);
set(6, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(1/32);
set(7, 0, 0, 128, 255);
wait(4);
</editor>
<h2>Waiting Explained</h2>
<p>As you can see in the above examples, besides <b>set</b>, the other thing we
can tell the Pixel Quilt to do is <b>wait</b>. We do so by writing
<code>wait</code> and parentheses just like for set, but this time we only need
to tell the quilt one thing: how long to wait.</p>
<code>wait(seconds)</code>
<p>The one value we need to give wait is how many seconds to wait. The quilt
will do all of the things we told it to do before (above) the wait line, then
it will wait as long as we asked, then it will do the things after (below) the
wait line.</p>
<p>When the pixel quilt is done doing everything you have told it, it will wait
1/60th of a second and then start over from the top again, creating a looping
animation.</p>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a1').style.display='block'">Which
of these will wait for the longest amount of time?<br>
<code>wait(5)</code><br>
<code>wait(3)</code><br>
<code>wait(1)</code>
</question>
<answer id="a1">Answer: wait(5)</answer>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a2').style.display='block'">How
many seconds will the Pixel Quilt wait if we say <code>wait(2)</code>?
</question>
<answer id="a2">Answer: 2 seconds</answer>
<h2>Waiting with Math</h2>
<p>Whenever we write a number in Pixel Quilt code, we can also write basic math
for the computer to figure out for us. For example, if we wrote
<code>1 + 2</code> that would be the same as writing <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of things we can do with math, the most common are
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Addition and subtraction
are pretty easy, using the + and - keys on the keyboard much like you would use
in math class. But most keyboards don't have &times; and &divide; keys, so how
do we multiply or divide?</p>
<p>Multiplication on computers is usually done using <code>*</code>, the
asterisk. Instead of 3 &times; 2 to get 6, we would write 3 * 2. In the same
way, we usually use a forward slash (<code>/</code>) to tell a computer to
divide. Thus a half would not be 1 &divide; 2, but 1 / 2.</p>
<p>This is useful with the Pixel Quilt because a whole second can be a long
time when talking about an animation. We may want something to change after
half a second, or a tenth of a second. We can do this easily using division:
</p>
<code>wait(1/2)</code><br>
<code>wait(1/10)</code>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a3').style.display='block'">Which
of these would we use to wait a quarter of a second?<br>
<code>wait(1 + 4)</code><br>
<code>wait(1 / 4)</code><br>
<code>wait(4 / 1)</code>
</question>
<answer id="a3">Answer: wait(1 / 4)</answer>
<question onclick="document.querySelector('#a4').style.display='block'">How
many times per second would the quilt change if we used
<code>wait(1/5)</code> between each change?
</question>
<answer id="a4">Answer: 5 times per second</answer>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
Change the below editor to make an animation where the red bar appears to move
across the display.
<editor>
set(0, 3, 255, 0, 0);
set(1, 3, 255, 0, 0);
set(2, 3, 255, 0, 0);
set(3, 3, 255, 0, 0);
</editor>
