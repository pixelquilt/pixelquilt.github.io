        <h1>Pixel Quilt Programming Guide</h1>
        <p>See the <a href="/tutorial" target="new">tutorials</a> for an introduction to Programming
        using the Pixel Quilt.</p>
        <p>
            Pixel Quilt videos can be programmed using any JavaScript functionality supported by your web browser.
            In addition, two special functions are provided:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>set(x, y, r, g, b)</li>
            <li>wait(seconds)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <b>set</b> function sets the color of the pixel at coordinate (x, y) to the color (r, g, b) where the color
            components are all values between 0 (off) and 255 (fully on). The "x" coordinate refers to the column on the
            quilt starting from 0 at the left side, and the "y" coordinate refers to the row starting from 0 at the top.
            The "r", "g", and "b" values refer to how much Red, Green, and Blue light should be emit by that pixel.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>wait</b> function waits the given number of (fractional) seconds before resuming execution. Pixel Quilts
            update the display 60 times per second, so for a smooth animation use "wait(1/60)" to advance to the next frame
            of animation.
        </p>
        <p>
            When execution of your code reaches the end, the video terminates and loops to the beginning again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combining <b>set</b> and <b>wait</b> functions you can set the colors of the pixels and then move to the next
            frame (a 60th of a second), or some other future point in order to create animations. Use the Render button to
            create a pixel quilt video file that can be run on a physical display.
        </p>
        <h2>Advanced Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Your code is executed in a dynamically created Web Worker in the background, passing messages to this
            application for display. In order for the <b>wait</b> function to work, the code has to be translated
            to turn 'wait(1)' into 'await wait(1)' in order to use JavaScript asynchronous functions correctly.
            This translation only works if the line starts with 'wait(', potentially after some spaces. If you need
            to call <b>wait</b> in other ways that won't be translated, make sure to use "await" to make the call.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, if you write functions that themselves need to call <b>wait</b>, you must declare them as
            async functions and call them using await. Failure to do this will cause waits to be ignored.
        </p>
